\section{Groups and Subgroups}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Left and right cancellation laws in groups
    \item Unique solution to all linear equations, and thus every element appears exactly once in every row and column of a group table
    \item Unique identity and inverse
    \item $(ab)'= b'a'$
    \item There are one group of order 1/2/3, up to isomorphism. There are two groups of order 4, up to isomorphism, $\Z_4$ and Klein 4-group $V$. Groups of order less than 6 are all abelian. The smallest nonabelian group is of order 6, and $S_3$ is a common counterexample to many claims.
    \item The only idempotent element of a group is the identity.
    \item $\Z_4$ has one nontrivial proper subgroup $\{0,2\}$, while $V$ has three: $\{e,a\}, \{e,b\},\{e,c\}$.
    \item To check if $H \subseteq G$ is a subgroup, we check $H$ is closed, $H$ has an identity, and the inverse exists for every element of $H$. Associativity is inherited from the whole group.
    \item $H = \{a^n \mid n \in \Z\}$ is the smallest subgroup of $G$ containing $a \in G$, called the cyclic subgroup of $G$ generated by $a$. $H$ can be denoted by $\langle a \rangle$. If $G$ is the whole group, then $a$ generates $G$ and $G$ is a cyclic group.
    \item Every cyclic group is abelian.
    \item A subgroup of a cyclic group is cyclic by the division algorithm. This implies that the subgroups of $\Z$ are the groups $n\Z$ (they are all the cyclic subgroups of $\Z$ generated by elements of $\Z$).
    \item The positive generator of $H = \{ar+bs \mid a,b \in \Z\}$ under addition is $\gcd(r,s)$.
    \item If $G = \langle a \rangle$ is infinite, then it is isomorphic to $\Z$ under addition; if it is finite, then it is isomorphic to $\Z_n$ under $+_n$. In the proof we show that for finite $\langle a \rangle$, the smallest number $m$ such that $a^m = e$ is its order. For infinite $\langle a \rangle$, m does not exist.
    \item $G = \langle a \rangle$ of order $n$, then $a^s$ generates a cyclic subgroup of order $\frac{n}{\gcd(n,s)}$. Also $\langle a^s \rangle = \langle a^t \rangle$ iff $\gcd(s,n)=\gcd(t,n)$.
    \item It follows that $a$ generates $G$ of order $n$, then all other generators of $G$ are $a^r$, where $r$ and $n$ are coprime.
    \item
